[1] I believe this NOTICE file substitutes multiple instances of that "legal" junk,
esp. keeping in mend that those "boilerplate" banners referred to this file, while
the original author had not bothered himself with composing one.
 For this very reason I've taken the liberty to drop such nonsense statements where
I felt them excessive.
